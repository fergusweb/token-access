# Token Access

A WordPress plugin to control access to your site.  Visitors will see a 'coming soon' page, unless they click a special link which sets a cookie token to give them access.

The cookie will expire after a set period of time.  You can configure these settings in the admin area (Settings > Reading), and even supply HTML code to use for the 'coming soon' page.

## SVN Deployment

I'm trying to use a Github workflow to auto-deploy tagged commits from git to the SVN Plugin Repository.
